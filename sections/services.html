                    <h2>UX Research</h2>
                    <p>User Research is one of the most important stages of UX design, and this is because there is a basic premise and that is that <b>all designs should be people-centered</b>, so I recommend that every time we are going to develop a digital product, <b>we involve the users of the product early on</b>.</p>
                    <p>User research focuses on <b>understanding</b> the characteristics and objectives, the most important thing is to <b>empathize</b> with the user's behaviors, needs and motivators through techniques and methods and methodologies.</p>
                    <p>The types of methods to use to perform user research will <b>depend</b> on each of the problems we are going to face.</p>
                    <p>When performing user research methods the most important thing is that the process must be <b>people-centered</b> and the segmentation of the people we are going to study will <b>depend on the problem</b>.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of conducting user research is to produce designs that <b>improve</b> their activities and better yet entire lives.</p>

                    <h2>UX Design</h2>
                    <p>The simplest way to think about user experience design is as a verb and a noun. A UX designer designs (verb)—ideates, plans, changes—the things that affect the user experience (noun)—perceptions and responses to a system or service. </p>
                    <p>I'll help you understanding how your product has to be built <b>priorizing our users needs</b> and easing their <b>pain points</b>.</p>
                    <p><b>Why, What and How of product use.</b> The <b>Why</b> involves the users’ motivations for adopting a product, whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to values and views that users associate with the ownership and use of the product. The <b>What</b> addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the <b>How</b> relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way.</p>

                    <h2>UI Design</h2>
                    <p>User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on <b>looks or style</b>. Designers aim to create interfaces which <b>users find easy to use</b> and pleasurable. UI design refers to <b>graphical</b> user interfaces and other forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces. </p>
                    <p>Users judge designs quickly and care about usability and likeability.
                    UIs should also be <b>enjoyable</b> (or at least satisfying and frustration-free).
                    UIs should <b>communicate</b> brand values and reinforce users’ trust.</p>

                    <p>We have our product, we know what's best for the user, the visual part and function. Now it's time to write our content to atract our users: <b>educate</b> them about our product and keep them <b>engaged</b>: let them know they are the most important about our company.</p>
                    <p>To accomplish this goal we must know our user perfectly.</p>
