        <h2>Early days</h2>
        <p>Since early days I've always been proactive: I bought my first electric guitar selling rings!</p>
        <p>So when I turn 16 I started my first real job: McDonald'</p>
        <p>After two years of hard work, be able to go on holidays with my friends and help economically at home I decided to look new challenges while I was studying Audiovisual Arts. So I worked as a waitress at Sheraton Hotel Buenos Aires and after 6 months I became the manager of a vegan restorant at Palermo's neightburhood</p>
        <p>But I had another plans for my life: I wanted to move to another state. That's where I question myself: how can I make money when I move? That's where "Melito's: vegan delicatessen" was born</p>

            <h2>My own business</h2>
            <p>In September of 2015 I started working on my new business: what would be the proposal? what should I sale? How I was going to sell? I had some money saved and I spend almost everything in things for my new business </p>
            <p>On January of 2016 I moved to another state: Paraná City where my aunt Rosa and grannys Sara and Julio lived </p>
            <p>I am really thankfull for they letting me go and live with them. They helped me a lot with my first days of Melito's ♥ </p>
            <p>I learned how to be a real entrepeneur and a business woman for 6 years with Melito's. In the middle, I made my studies as a cook and restaruant administrations and other professional formations like digital marketing, business, food photography and more.</p>
