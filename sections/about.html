        <h2>Early days</h2>
        <p>Since early days I've always been proactive: I bought my first electric guitar selling rings!</p>
        <p>So when I turn 16 I started my first real job: McDonald's</p>
        <p>After two years of hard work, be able to go on holidays with my friends and help economically at home I decided to look new challenges while I was studying Audiovisual Arts. So I worked as a <b>waitress</b> at Sheraton Hotel Buenos Aires and after 6 months I became <b>manager at a vegan restorant</b> at Palermo's neightburhood</p>
        <p>But I had another plans for my life: I wanted to move to another state. That's where I question myself: how can I make money when I move? That's where <b>"Melito's: vegan delicatessen"</b> was born</p>

            <h2>My own business</h2>
            <p>In September of 2015 I started working on my new business: <b>what would be the proposal? what should I sale? How I was going to sell?</b> I had some money saved and I spend almost everything in things for my new business </p>
            <p>On January of 2016 I moved to another state: Paraná City where my aunt Rosa and grannys Sara and Julio lived </p>
            <p>I am really <b>thankfull</b> for they letting me go and live with them. They helped me a lot with my first days of Melito's ♥ </p>
            <p>I learned how to be a real <b>entrepeneur and a business woman</b> for 6 years with Melito's. In the middle, I made my <b>studies as a cook and restaruant administrations</b> and other professional formations like <b>digital marketing, business, food photography</b> and more.</p>
            <p>You can take a look at my Melito's <b> Instagram</b> <a href="http://instagram.com/melitosveg">here</a></p>

            <h2>IT world</h2>
            <p>After 6 years of hard working as a cook I realised I wanted to accomplish another wishes I had since I was little: <b>create websites</b></p>
            <p>So on September 2021 I looked for new courses to learn and made a research about which <b>jobs I was interested in the IT World.</b> That's when I decided to try out <b>User Experience Design.</b></p>
             <p>And jackspot! This career is everything I love: being <b>curious, creative, proactive, help people to make their own web products.</b></p>
             <p>Since that date till October 2022 I have accomplished these courses:</p>
