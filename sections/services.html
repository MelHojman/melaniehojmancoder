                    <h2>UX Research</h2><br>
                    <p>User Research is one of the most important stages of UX design, and this is because there is a basic premise and that is that all designs should be people-centered, so we recommend that every time we are going to develop a digital product, we involve the users of the product early on. <br>
                    <br>
                    User research focuses on understanding the characteristics and objectives, the most important thing is to empathize with the user's behaviors, needs and motivators through techniques and methods and methodologies.<br>
                    <br>
                    The types of methods to use to perform user research will depend on each of the problems we are going to face.<br>
                    <br>
                    When performing user research methods the most important thing is that the process must be people-centered and the segmentation of the people we are going to study will depend on the problem.<br>
                    <br>
                    The purpose of conducting user research is to produce designs that improve their activities and better yet entire lives.</p>

                    <h2>UX Design</h2><br>
                    <p>The simplest way to think about user experience design is as a verb and a noun. A UX designer designs (verb)—ideates, plans, changes—the things that affect the user experience (noun)—perceptions and responses to a system or service. <br>

                    I'll help you understanding how your product has to be built priorizing our users needs and easing their pain points. <br>
                    <br>
                    Why, What and How of product use. The Why involves the users’ motivations for adopting a product, whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to values and views that users associate with the ownership and use of the product. The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way.</p>

                    <h2>UI Design</h2><br>
                    <p>User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces. <br>
                    <br>
                    Users judge designs quickly and care about usability and likeability.
                    UIs should also be enjoyable (or at least satisfying and frustration-free).
                    UIs should communicate brand values and reinforce users’ trust.
